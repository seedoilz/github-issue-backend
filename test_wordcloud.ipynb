We cannot fully fix all scaladoc warnings due to limitations of the scaladoc tool, so this is a best-effort attempt at fixing as many warnings as possible. We also disable one problematic class of scaladoc wornings (link errors) in the gradle build.  The causes of existing warnings are that we link to java members from scaladoc, which is not possible, or we fail to disambiguate some members.  The broad rule applied in the changes is  - For links to Java members such as [[StateStore]], we use the fully qualified name in a code tag to make manual link resolution via a search engine easy.  - For some common terms that are also linked to Java members, like [[Serde]], we omit the link.  - We disambiguate where possible.  - In the special case of @throws declarations with Java Exceptions, we do not seem to be able to avoid the warning altogther.  ### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message) - [x] Verify design and implementation  - [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status - [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)  ', '@mjsax can we merge this?

Currently they do no handle nested content because of the way they use relative URLs. - [ ] Ideally turn sphinx-build warnings into errors.  ## Content - [ ] Restore [protocol.html](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/docs/protocol.html). This was not directly referenced anywhere, but I think we still want to maintain it. (I think this is mostly content now; there\\'s some import of autogenerated content, but I think I\\'ve resolved that process.) - [ ] Fix sphinx build warnings, especially the ones for missing images and invalid references. (If any of these aren\\'t content-based, add items in the tooling section for the specific issues.) - [ ] Restore missing upgrade section (and possibly some other missing intro sections?). For example, there are links to streams upgrade notes missing. - [ ] Check links and table formatting for tables, especially in streams, e.g. notice that dsl-api has broken links and extra spaces in some cases because of line wrapping. We may need to investigate a better table solution for cases where we have very large blocks of text/long rst commands inside them. (This might end up needing a tooling solution; tables seem... painful for the large content we tend to house in them.) - [ ] Ensure there\\'s no overlap/confusion in the new nested. For example, I see `documentation/streams.rst`, but `documentation/streams/index.rst` may not strictly collide, but if we want urls with `/streams` to not conflict with `/streams/` (which commonly would resolve to `/streams/index.html`, including with our setup), we want to be careful about potential naming conflicts (and compatibility challenges) like this. - [ ] Top-level organization under /documentation/? Weird top-level of  `[quickstart, uses, documentation/index]` toc that\\'s thin and a weird docs intro compared to current approach of \"dump everything immediately\". Flatten with content under `documentation/`? - [ ] I think https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/docs/streams/developer-guide/memory-mgmt.html and https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/docs/streams/developer-guide/testing.html are missing equivalents. Right now since the structure of streams docs is basically the same we should be able to rely on the same file names instead of needing redirects. - [ ] Update to current content -- merge conflicts.  ## Styling Worst case, we can live with some styling issues for a time, but we can at least track the issues here: - [ ] Do something about styling of the sphinx-generated tables. raw-included tables have the right classes, but auto-generated ones from sphinx have a different class on them that causes styling to be different (and ugly).  Some questions for you: * I ended up leaving the nav as it is today. This was mostly because of styling -- I don\\'t think it\\'s a huge deal to do it, I mostly had it, but we basically have to figure out how to map the elements generated by sphinx to the ones we already have styling for (or get the style to generate a different format which is probably just messing with some templates, but will take me awhile to figure out the details of). We can get nested levels of navs if we end up wanting them, but it was easier to leave as is for now since it mostly matches the second level anyway so we\\'d only be getting the value out of deeper nesting. * I stripped breadcrumbs and left them as a TODO since we don\\'t have existing styling. Do we think these are useful and if so, do we need them now or can leave as future improvement. * Should we turn on strict builds (warnings are errors)? I see quite a few warnings and it seems easier to just enforce this now. Ideally it would then also be enforced as part of every PR (we\\'d have to check what commands run on Jenkins but it would basically be free). We\\'d obviously need to clean up the existing warnings before turning it on. * For pages like connect, do you want to preemptively put them into a directory with /index.html now? If we do that then we\\'ll ideally end up with fewer redirects to maintain in the future. We\\'ll still be able to link those ones without the index.html (e.g. http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/connect/). * How do we want to handle existing links to element IDs, especially ones like those used in the nav (but all of which may linked to from other sites), e.g. http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect. Best I can think of is to get the full list based on the TOC, and then do redirects, either in JS or in the .htaccess.  ', \"@joel-hamill @guozhangwang Made a bunch of updates today to get us closer to functional/committable. Includes lots of sphinx customization to make it more usable for us.  Most importantly, have been updating my last comment with the TODO list with stuff I've found along the way: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4536#issuecomment-368688160. I've categorized stuff to help us split up work that can be tackled easily by different folks: tooling stuff is probably either me or somebody else familiar with sphinx (though really any developer); content could be handled by anyone -- @joel-hamill, streams developers, tools devs, etc --; and styling requires some CSS combined with understanding/running the docs build & kafka apache httpd setup.  I'm trying to add only things that I'd view as blockers to that list -- the stuff below the fold on that comment is stuff we decided we could follow up on later, even if it's technically a regression (generally just a styling/experience thing) from the current state since we'll be in a more reasonable, sustainable, state.  To summarize my view of current state: * Tooling: I think mostly in good shape. Redirects are still a bit scary, but I think it's the last thing to sort out. Tables and their formatting seem the other messiest thing that might bubble up. If there are bright ideas on how to handle that, let me know as we've already done a couple of custom extensions. * Content: Regressions in table formatting / links is biggest concern. Missing sections that need porting are next highest. Generally seems like it shouldn't be a problem, just some work porting/reorganizing content. * Styling: the least of my concerns. I think this should be easily fixable, just not important enough to investigate quite yet. \", '@ewencp re: `Content: Regressions in table formatting / links is biggest concern...` - do you have a list of the specific items? should they be fixed in this PR, or a follow-on? ', '@joel-hamill One example is https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4536/files#diff-ce1711dfc45980e53ccabbba7ef3ee4bR1160 where we have both the left column and right column wrapped in a way that either makes formatting weird (extra spaces) or breaks the embedded rst directives (the run, but due to the wrapping they generate incorrect links).  It seems like the built-in table functionality for rst doesn\\'t handle \"large\" content well. Like the other customizations I added, we might need to consider an extension to make this more reasonable. Don\\'t know if you have thoughts about good ways to handle tables like these. This is one case where HTML actually seems to shine -- they\\'re not necessarily easy to understand quickly and visually from the html, but they are sane to write & maintain.

I updated the PR ', \"@nicodds -- Thinking about this again, I am actually wondering why the value must be smaller then `max.poll.interval.ms` ? If a tasks idles, we should will call `poll()` frequently so both configs should actually be independent?  On the Jira ticket you claim:  > otherwise you'll incur into an endless rebalancing problem  Did you observe this in practice? Wondering, as it seems it should actually not be a problem. Can you clarify? \", ' Exactly. I was building a kafka-streams application in wich human-unreadable messages in a topic (A) are joined against the data into another topic (B). Data in topic B may arrive later than in topic A. Consequently, I personalized one of the examples in which `max.task.idle.ms` is used for that purpose. Incidentally, I changed the value of `max.poll.interval.ms` to a short value, shorter than `max.task.idle.ms`, and I started experiencing frequent rebalancing.  I suspect that the idle prevent the tasks from giving a sign of their presence, thus they are disconnected from the consumer group.  Let me know if you need any further thing.  All the best, Nico ', 'Hi @nicodds ,  I can see your line of reasoning, but I think there must be something else going on there.  When a task is \"idling\", it does not block the poll loop. Rather, in each iteration of the poll loop, the task pseudocode is like this:  ``` checks if it has records buffered from both inputs   if so, carry on processing   if not, check if the idle timeout has been exceeded     if so, carry on processing     if not, loop around again and maybe call poll() ```  Therefore, I don\\'t think task idling can make you miss your poll interval. My guess is that when you set the poll interval lower, it happened to be smaller than the amount of time it takes to complete one loop of processing each task. In that case, the poll would timeout, causing a rebalance.  In fact, my typical advice for cases like yours is the opposite of what this PR says: to make sure that the task idle time is _larger_ than the poll interval. As Matthias mentioned, task idling is pointless unless we actually call poll() again at least once before the timeout. In other words, I think your reasoning was correct, but some other factor came into play and caused the rebalances.  FYI, it doesn\\'t help you right now, but I have just completed this feature, to be released in Kafka 3.0: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-695%3A+Further+Improve+Kafka+Streams+Timestamp+Synchronization  KIP-695 will make it so that you should get the desired join behavior by default, without having to mess with the task idling timeout at all. But it\\'s not coming until 3.0 is released. Until then, maybe you can try returning the poll interval to the default and instead increasing the task idle time to be larger than the poll interval.  I hope this helps! -John ', 'Closing this PR due to inactivity. @nicodds Feel free to re-open if you see fit.
